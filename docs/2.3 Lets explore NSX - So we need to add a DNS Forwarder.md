Challenge 2.3
"Lets explore NSX - So we need to add a DNS Forwarder"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Configure a DNS forwarder within NSX such that the On Prem FQDN can be resolved from AVS itself

Since the default DNS is preconfigured with AVS, to test DNS we are using a feature where we need name resolution

As a part of this challenge you are also expected to <u>log on to the AVS Private cloud assigned to your team</u> and create a DNS forwarder within NSX such that the On Prem FQDN can be resolved from AVS itself. You can use this to also import images from On Prem to AVS using a content library which is configured On Prem

## Use Case Tip 

By default, Azure VMware Solution management components such as vCenter can only resolve name records available through Public DNS. However, certain hybrid use cases require Azure VMware Solution management components to resolve name records from privately hosted DNS to properly function, including customer-managed systems such as vCenter and Active Directory.

Private DNS for Azure VMware Solution management components lets you define conditional forwarding rules for the desired domain name to a selected set of private DNS servers through the NSX-T DNS Service.

This capability uses the DNS Forwarder Service in NSX-T. A DNS service and default DNS zone are provided as part of your private cloud. To enable Azure VMware Solution management components to resolve records from your private DNS systems, you must define an FQDN zone and apply it to the NSX-T DNS Service. The DNS Service conditionally forwards DNS queries for each zone based on the external DNS servers defined in that zone.

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. 

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server and the NSX Manager.

## Challenge 

By the end of this challenge you should independantly be able to answer the following questions

1. What benefits does DNS forwarder get here?
2. How can you resolve AVS On-Prem FQDN on AVS?
3. How will you go about configuring LDAP integration for NSX?

## Configure a DNS forwarder

1.  In your Azure VMware Solution private cloud, under Workload Networking, select DNS > DNS zones. Then select Add.

2.  Add the On-Prem FQDN zone by inputting details regarding the DNS Zone Name, Domain Name and DNS Seever IP from the Credentials&IP document and press save

3.  Attach the configured DNS Zone name to Default DNS Zone and press save

4.  Now create a content library within the On Prem vCenter Server by providing the relavant details on the content library

5.  For the new content library, select local content library and enable publishing

6.  In order to obtain the link of the content library, right click the newly created content library and copy link

5.  Now proceed to the AVS side and create a new content library and select subscribed content library and paste the content library link from On-Prem side.

It important to note if AVS didnt have the ON-Prem FQDN configured within the DNS zones of AVS, you wouldnt add the content library from On-Prem to AVS.

### Note : 

These DNS zones are a prerequisite for LDAP configuration for NSX.

This concludes the NSX DNS Forwarder for AVS!!
