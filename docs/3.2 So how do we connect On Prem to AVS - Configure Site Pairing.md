Challenge 3.2
"So how do we connect On Prem to AVS? - Configure Site Pairing"
---

# Introduction

In this challenge, you will perform the following tasks:

1.	Configure Site Pair

As a part of this challenge you are expected to <u>log on to the On Prem and AVS vCenter servers. You will also be expected to log on to HCX manager and configure HCX from On Prem</u> and connect it with AVS and deploy the interconnect and network extension appliances such that migration and network extension related activities can be achieved 

Please carefully follow the instructions provided by your facilitator. Incorrectly deploying the HCX may result in multiple forthcoming steps not operating as expected.

Work with the instructor to ensure your VMware environment has the required permissions to access your AVS vCenter Server.

## Configure Site Pairing

Now you're ready to add a site pairing, create a network and compute profile, and enable services such as migration and network extension.

 ### Note

To successfully establish a site pair:
Your VMware HCX Connector must be able to route to your HCX Cloud Manager IP over port 443.

You'll see a screen showing that your VMware HCX Cloud Manager in Azure VMware Solution and your on-premises VMware HCX Connector are connected (paired).
